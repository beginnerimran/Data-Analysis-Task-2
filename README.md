1. Sales by Category (Column Chart)

This chart shows the total sales for each product category in the store. It helps us quickly see which types of products generate the most revenue. For example, Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology are compared side by side so we can identify the top-selling category at a glance.

2. Sales by Customer Segment (Pie Chart)

The pie chart displays the proportion of sales contributed by each customer segmentâ€”Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. It provides a simple visual to understand which group of customers buys the most from the store, making it easy to spot the largest contributors to revenue.

3. Sales Over Time (Line Chart)

This line chart shows how sales change over time, typically by month or year. It allows us to see trends, such as peak sales periods or seasonal patterns, helping businesses understand when they sell the most and plan accordingly.

4. Region Filter (Slicer)

The slicer acts as a filter for the dashboard. By selecting a region, all the charts update to show data only for that specific area. This makes it simple to explore performance in different regions without creating separate charts for each one.
